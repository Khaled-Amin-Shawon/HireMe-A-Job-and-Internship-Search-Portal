## **Why Agile is the Best Fit**
1. **Iterative Development**: Agile allows you to build the project in small, manageable increments, which is ideal for a complex platform like *HireMe* that requires multiple features (web scraping, user roles, search functionality, etc.).
   
2. **Flexibility**: As the project evolves, new requirements or changes can be incorporated without disrupting the entire development process.

3. **Continuous Feedback**: Agile emphasizes regular feedback from stakeholders, ensuring the platform meets user needs and expectations throughout development.

4. **Faster Delivery**: Agile focuses on delivering functional parts of the software (e.g., job search, scraping, or employer management modules) early, enabling quicker time-to-market for critical features.

5. **Risk Management**: By testing and validating each feature incrementally, you can identify and address issues early, reducing the risk of significant failures later.

## Relationships

- **Users Table**:
  - The **UserID** is referenced by the **Applications** table to track job applications made by job seekers.
  
- **Jobs Table**:
  - The **JobID** is referenced by both the **Applications** table (for job applications) and the **ScrapedJobs** table (for jobs scraped from external sources).

- **Applications Table**:
  - The **UserID** in the **Applications** table references the **Users** table (Job Seekers).
  - The **JobID** in the **Applications** table references the **Jobs** table.

- **Employers Table**:
  - The **EmployerID** is referenced in the **Jobs** table to specify the employer posting a particular job.

- **ScrapedJobs Table**:
  - The **JobID** in the **ScrapedJobs** table references the **Jobs** table to map the scraped job data.

This relational database design ensures that all entities (users, jobs, applications, employers, and scraped jobs) are properly structured and linked, enabling efficient querying and data retrieval.

# Deployment Phase

### 1 Pre-Deployment

-   **Environment Setup**: Prepare development, staging, and production environments. Ensure all necessary tools and frameworks are installed.
-   **Database Setup**: Create and configure the production database based on the design schema and migrate initial data.
-   **Backup Plan**: Set up regular backup strategies for data protection.

### 2 Deployment Strategy

-   **CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up continuous integration and deployment using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. This ensures that the code is automatically tested and deployed after each change.
-   **Hosting**: Host the application on a cloud service (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) and configure the necessary web servers (Nginx/Apache).

### 3 Production Environment

-   **Server Setup**: Configure production servers with the necessary software and services, including setting up reverse proxy if needed.
-   **Domain & SSL**: Register a domain (e.g., hireme.com) and secure it with an SSL certificate to ensure encrypted communication.

### 4 Post-Deployment

-   **Testing in Production**: Perform basic tests like smoke and performance testing to ensure the system works smoothly in the live environment.
-   **Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Sentry) to track the performance and errors of the application.

### 5 Scaling & Maintenance

-   **Scaling**: As the user base grows, scale the application using horizontal or vertical scaling.
-   **Ongoing Maintenance**: Regularly update the system with bug fixes, security patches, and new features.


----------

# Launch and Review Phase

###  Launch

-   **Go Live**: Officially launch the _HireMe_ platform to the public after completing deployment and post-deployment testing.
-   **User Onboarding**: Guide new users (job seekers and employers) through the registration process and platform features.
-   **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on the platform’s performance, including server uptime, page load times, and resource usage.

### Review

-   **Feedback Collection**: Gather feedback from initial users to identify any issues, challenges, or areas for improvement.
    
    -   This can include surveys, user testing, or direct feedback channels on the platform.
-   **Bug Fixes & Improvements**: Based on user feedback and monitoring data, quickly address any bugs, glitches, or missing features to improve the user experience.
    
-   **Performance Optimization**: If the system is handling high traffic, optimize areas such as database queries, server load, and page rendering speed.
    

###  Post-Launch Monitoring

-   **Continuous Monitoring**: Use analytics tools to track usage, error rates, and user behavior to ensure the platform remains stable and user-friendly.
-   **Regular Updates**: Plan periodic updates to add new features, improve security, and resolve any issues based on ongoing user feedback.

----------


# 1. Maintenance Phase

The **Maintenance** phase ensures the _HireMe_ platform remains functional, secure, and up-to-date throughout its lifecycle.


## 1.1 Monitoring and Support

-   **System Monitoring**: Regularly monitor the platform for any performance issues, downtimes, or errors. Use tools like New Relic or Datadog to track system health and error logs.
-   **User Support**: Provide customer support for any issues faced by users, such as registration problems, job applications, or account management.

## 1.2 Bug Fixes and Updates

-   **Bug Resolution**: Address any bugs or issues that arise post-launch. Prioritize fixing critical bugs that impact user experience.
-   **Feature Updates**: Release periodic updates to improve existing features, add new functionality, and improve overall user experience.
-   **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches and updates to the platform’s software and database to prevent vulnerabilities.

## 1.3 Performance Optimization

-   **Scalability**: As user numbers grow, ensure the platform scales effectively. This may involve optimizing server resources, adding more instances, or enhancing database performance.
-   **Speed Improvements**: Optimize the website's speed by compressing images, minimizing CSS/JS files, and optimizing database queries for faster load times.

## 1.4 Data Management

-   **Data Backup**: Ensure regular backups of user data, job postings, and applications. Test the backup and restore process periodically.
-   **Database Cleanup**: Periodically clean the database by removing outdated job listings and applications that are no longer needed.
